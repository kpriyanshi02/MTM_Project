# MTM_Project
This project is based on Machine Translation Model.
So, basically this model is based on machine translation using machine learning that converts English language to Hindi language.
 
 I have used various modules such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, string.
 I have also used various libraries such as keras , sklearn.
