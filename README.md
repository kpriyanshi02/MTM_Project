# MTM_Project

The project is based on machine translation using Machine Learning that converts English language to Hindi language.
 
 - I have used various modules such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, string,re , seaborn.
 - I have also used various libraries such as keras , sklearn, tensorflow.
 
I have used the encoder-decoder model which is a way of using recurrent neural networks for sequence-tosequence prediction problems. 
The approach involves two recurrent neural networks, one to encode the input sequence, called the encoder, and a second to decode the encoded input sequence into the target sequence called the decoder.
